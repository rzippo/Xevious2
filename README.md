# Xevious2

Developed as project for Web Development exam.
The name is inspired by Xevious, an old shoot-em up, but the gameplay was then heavily changed to experiment with the game design.
The project involves both frontend and backend development.

Notable quirks of the project are:
- There are various types of enemies, ships and weapons, with different behaviours obtained with frame-by-frame scripting.
- There is a game currency obtained by killing enemies, and a shop where ships, weapons or weapon upgrades can be bought.
- At the start of each game the player can choose its loadout, that is ship and weapons to use.
- There is challenge mechanic, accessible through leaderboards, which allows to play the exact same game of another player to beat its score.
  This is obtained by sharing the seed of the RNG, which determines the enemy spawns: when they happen, of which type, in which initial direction, and so on.
